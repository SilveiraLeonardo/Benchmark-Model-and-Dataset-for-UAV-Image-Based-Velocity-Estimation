We introduced a large-scale dataset for UAV linear velocity estimation. We used AirSim to record in-flight images of drones flying in different scenarios and with different atmospheric conditions. Additionally, we used this dataset to train a deep learning model for the vehicle velocity estimation. This trained network can be used as an initial baseline for other researchers that may use the dataset, as well as a starting model for real world applications of drone speed estimation.
